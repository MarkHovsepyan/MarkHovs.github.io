#### Intro
I am a man of thousand interests, some may call me "Jack of all trades, master of none", which would be a fair description of my persona with the addition of "though oftentimes better than master of one" to the end of it. 
<br>
My main professional interests are mainly revolving around technological advancement and innovation. I am a computer scientist, currently working remotely as a software engineer, focusing on development of smart assisstants. 
<br>
I am a co-founder and the CEO of [TutWiser](https://tutwiser.com), where I work on developing an educational infrastructure and building tools for tutoring services.
<br>
I am never stopping to learn new things and I perceive my life as a big game, where self-development is equivalent to level advancement. I am open to new opportunities, interesting projects or anything that sounds exciting. I am available to consult on interesting projects or even undertake/supervise some short-term projects.
<br><br>
#### Currently
While in University, I have gained numerous skills in different fields and after graduation I am now applying my skills as computer scientist, enterpreneur, public speaker and many others for my career and future endeavours. I am aiming to continue my education in Germany and eventually get a PhD degree, succeed as an enterpreneur and a software engineer.

#### Some history

- I was bilingual when I was only 2 years old. At that time I was native in both Russian and Armenian languages.

- My first interaction with a computer system was when my parents bought me a SEGA system on my 4th birthday. To this day I remember playing "Sonic: The Hedgehog" and learning every secret of the game. I bet there still are hidden passages that I did not manage to discover back then.

- I remember going to different places with my parents and every time I noticed a computer in a room I couldn't get my eyes off it. I loved sitting in front of computers and just discovering all of the little things that operating systems of those times could offer.

- At 5, I was able to do all of the simple numerical operations, like addition, subtraction, divison, multiplication and even squaring.

- At 6, I started going to school, which I absolutely hated. At the same time I started attending a music school, where I was getting formal musical education and learning to play piano.

- At 7, I got my very own computer which was one of the happiest moments of my life up until that time. 

- I also learned to play chess when I was 7 and absolutely loved the game. I always wish to play more chess than I actually manage to.

- The first computer game that I played was probably Pinball, which I played on the computer of my father's workplace. However, the first game that I installed and played on my very own computer was the famous "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas".

- At 8, I quit Karate dojo, which I hated, and started attending swimming classes. Learning to swim was one of the best things and till this day I attend a swimming pool regularly.

- By the age of 9, I was fluent in English and it became my third language.

- At 10, I was experimenting with my computer and I learned how to fully disassemble and assemble back it back. I could also format the hard drives and install an OS.

- I was 11 when I participted in Kangaroo mathematics and logical thinking competition and got an impressive school-wide high-score.

- When I was 12, I started playing basketball and fell in love with it. I was originally inspired by the movie "Spcae Jam" and I asked my dad to register me to a basketball club, where a wonderful sports journey had begun.

- At 13, I managed to beat my dad at chess for the first time and got really excited about board games. I had a small collection of my favorite board games among which one of my favorites was the famous Monopoly.

- At 14, I started learning things about programming and a whole new world of previously invisible layers of technology has oppended up for me. I built my first HTML/CSS website and I was proud to be able to create my first working application.

- I solved my first Rubik's Cube at 14, which led to the development of another huge hobby of mine.

- When I was 15, I started paying more attention to my classes. I started to excel at Math, Physics, Biology and a number of other subjects. I participated in Olympiads and even received some qualifications in Math, Biology and Chess.

- At 16, I worked really hard took TOEFL IBT and SAT Math exams, which were the first steps towards my future university admission.

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Age of Empires 3, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Civilization V, Dark Souls, Skyrim, Fallout.

- At 18, I have been writing programs in C++, Java and JavaScript. I was fully invested in programming and built many small applications. Later I got into Android development.

- At 19, I was heavily involved with NGOs, I was an active participant of EYP Armenia and AEGEE-Yerevan conferences. I took the role of a forum organizer for the first time and later that year I travelled to Romania to participae in an international forum.

- At 20, I wrote my first academic paper in the field of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing based on my capstone project.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
