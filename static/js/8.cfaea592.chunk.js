At that time I was native in both Russian and Armenian languages.\n\n- My first interaction with a computer system was when my parents bought me a SEGA system on my 4th birthday. To this day I remember playing "Sonic: The Hedgehog" and learning every secret of the game. I bet there still are hidden passages that I did not manage to discover back then.\n\n- I remember going to different places with my parents and every time I noticed a computer in a room I couldn\'t get my eyes off it. I loved sitting in front of computers and just discovering all of the little things that operating systems of those times could offer.\n\n- At 6, I started going to school, which I absolutely hated. At the same time I started attending a music school, where I was getting formal musical education and learning to play piano.\n\n- At 7, I got my very own computer which was one of the happiest moments of my life up until that time. Spent so much time messing with it and playing games...those were the good days.\n\n- The first computer game that I played was probably Pinball, which I played on the computer of my father\'s workplace. However, the first game that I installed and played on my very own computer was the famous "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas".\n\n- I also learned to play chess when I was 7 and absolutely loved the game. I always wish to play more chess than I actually manage to.\n\n- At 8, I quit Karate dojo, which I hated, and started attending swimming classes. Learning to swim was one of the best things and till this day I tend to attend a swimming pool regularly.\n\n- By the age of 9, I was pretty good at English and it became my third language.\n\n- At 10, I was experimenting with my computer and I learned how to fully disassemble and assemble it back. I could also format the hard drives and install an OS.\n\n- I was 11 when I participted in Kangaroo mathematics and logical thinking competition and got an impressive high-score.\n\n- When I was 12, I started playing basketball and fell in love with it. I was originally inspired by the movie "Spcae Jam" and I asked my dad to register me to a basketball club, where I began a wonderful sports journey.\n\n- At 13, I managed to beat my dad at chess for the first time and got really excited about board games. I had a small collection of my favorite board games among which one of my favorites was the famous Monopoly.\n\n- At 14, I started learning things about programming and a whole new world of previously invisible layers of technology has oppended up for me. I built my first HTML/CSS website and I was proud to be able to create my first working application.\n\n- I solved my first Rubik\'s Cube at 14, which led to the development of another huge hobby of mine.\n\n- When I was 15, I started paying more attention to my classes. I started to excel at Math, Physics, Biology and a number of other subjects.\n\n- At 16, I worked really hard and took TOEFL IBT and SAT Math exams, which were the first steps towards my future university admission.\n\n- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Skyrim, Dark Souls, Age of Empires 3, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Civilization and Fallout.\n\n- At 18, I have been writing programs in C++, Java and JavaScript. I was fully invested in programming and built many small applications. Later I got into Android development too.\n\n- At 19, I was heavily involved with NGOs, I was an active participant of EYP Armenia and AEGEE-Yerevan conferences. I took the role of a forum organizer for the first time and later that year I travelled to Romania to participae in an international forum.\n\n- At 20, I wrote my first academic paper in the field of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing based for my capstone project.\n\n- At 21, I started to learn German and eventually got certified.\n\n- The journey continues and is well underway. This section will get more highlights from my life endeavors in the future.\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I\'m afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Animals\n- Playing Basketball\n- Playing Piano\n- Skiing\n- Ice Skating\n- Chess\n- Rubik\'s Cubes (and many other puzzles)\n- Nature (hiking, sea, forests, etc.)\n- Space\n- [Games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/markhovs/) (Computer and Board)\n- Summer Activities\n- Books\n- Movies and Anime\n- Drawing\n- [Good design](/)\n- Video Editing\n- Photography\n- Classical Music\n- Youtube\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Yerevan, Armenia and I live here right now.\n- Traveled and lived in France for a while.\n- Got some plans that I am working on.
